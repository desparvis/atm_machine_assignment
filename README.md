# ATM MACHINE PROGRAM

- This is a C program that is made to simply simulate what an ATM machine does which is help people deposit, withdraw, and check their funds.

- This C program has functions used for different actions like:
1. **check_balance()** for checking the balance.
2. **deposit()** for depositing funds.
2. **withdraw()** for withdrawing funds.

- This program uses loops to make sure that the program keeps running. The user also has the choice the exit the program once they don't want to use it anymore.

- This program also validates inputs to ensure that inputs for withdraw, deposit are valid for the program to be able to perform as expected

- Please compile the **atm.c** file before you can run it
